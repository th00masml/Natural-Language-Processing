Repo contains some of my work on nlp during last year. 
Free files are just some scripts I used for different projects.

Gensim - contains some of my work with gensim. I find it quite interesting, but it could be more accessible.

Nltk_book-Jupyter - contains some of my basic work with NLTK Book.

Nltk_Jupyter-Notebooks - is collection of algorithms used with Spam filtering.
