    "text = \"Is it the ever-changing light and the dark seas? Ireland has long been home to solitudes and to the kind of logical and metaphysical play that breeds on solitude. The lineage stretches from Duns Scotus (the name is, in fact, a misnomer) to Bishop Berkeley and Beckett, that virtuoso of aloneness and negativity. Wittgenstein's visits to Ireland began in 1936 and resumed in 1938. The years 1947 to 1949 found Wittgenstein spending months in Dublin and Co Wicklow. Time and again, he considered establishing himself in Ireland, possibly to practise psychiatric medicine. Much of the work which led to the Philosophical Investigations was done in Ireland\"\n",
